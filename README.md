# NMEG Isotopes
## By: Kimberly Samuels-Crow, Emma Reich, Kiona Ogle, Marcy Litvak

Isotope data (δ<sup>2</sup>H [δD] and δ<sup>18</sup>O) from stems and soil collected at New Mexico Elevation Gradient sites in 2019 and 2021.

## Field and Lab Methods

We collected stems and soil from a subset of [NMEG sites](https://www.litvaklab.org/new-mexico-elevation-gradient.html): a creosote shrubland (US-Ses) sampled in October 2019 and June 2021, juniper savannah (US-Wjs) sampled in June 2021, piñon-juniper woodland (US-Mpj) sampled in October 2019 and June 2021, and ponderosa pine forest (US-Vcp) sampled in 2019. Stems and soil were collected using methods described in [Samuels-Crow et al. (2023) ](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2023.1116786/full). Samples collected in 2019 were prepared and analyzed using methods described in [Samuels-Crow et al. (2023) ](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2023.1116786/full). Samples collected in 2021 were prepared and analyzed at [University of Wyoming's Stable Isotope Facility](https://www.uwyo.edu/sif/index.html).

## Data Columns

This repository includes one data file with isotope results from the 2019 and 2021. The column headers in the file are as follows

| Column Name | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------|
| Vial Number | number for field vial |
| Soil or Stem | Identifies the sample type |
| SampleYear | 2019 or 2021 |
| SampleDate | Date sample was collected |
| Site | NMEG site name |
| Plant | plant number where stem or soil sample was taken |
| soil max depth (cm) | maximum depth for the soil sample interval in cm |
| stem rep or pooled | 3 stems were collected per plant and either analyzed separately or pooled |
| δD | δ<sup>2</sup>H results in per mil |
| δ<sup>18</sup>O | δ<sup>18</sup>O results in per mil |
| Notes | Any quality control notes |
