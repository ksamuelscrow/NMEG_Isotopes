# NMEG Isotopes
## By: Kimberly Samuels-Crow, Emma Reich, Kiona Ogle, Marcy Litvak

Isotope data from stems and soil collected at New Mexico Elevation Gradient sites in 2019 and 2021.

## Field and Lab Methods

We collected stems and soil from a subset of [NMEG sites](https://www.litvaklab.org/new-mexico-elevation-gradient.html): a creosote shrubland (US-Ses), juniper savannah (US-Wjs), pi√±on-juniper woodland (US-Mpj), and ponderosa pine forest (US-Vcp). Stems and soil were collected using methods described in [Samuels-Crow et al. (2023) ](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2023.1116786/full). Samples collected in 2019 were prepared and analyzed using methods described in [Samuels-Crow et al. (2023) ](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2023.1116786/full). Samples collected in 2021 were prepared and analyzed at [University of Wyoming's Stable Isotope Facility](https://www.uwyo.edu/sif/index.html).
